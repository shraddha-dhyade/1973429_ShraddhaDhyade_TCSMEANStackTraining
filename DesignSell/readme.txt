In the stylesheet styles.css, I have used various css selectors

Global class selector to set font family, font size and text alignment

Specific selector to select h1 tag and applied attributes to the h1 tag

Local class selector to select divClass tag and applied attributes to the divClass class tags

Specific selector to select tag by id for input button tag and applied attributes to that tag
